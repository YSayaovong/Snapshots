Your assignment here is to document the following process:

Create a snapshot in VMWare.
Open an administrative powershell window in your windows VM (right click the windows icon [start menu button in the bottom left] and click "Windows Powershell (Admin)"
Run this command: iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.saik0.com/asu/IFT103/raw/branch/master/Module_02/snapshots_lab'))
Observe the VM for the next few minutes.
Describe what happens. Is the VM functional? Hint: if your machine appears "fine" start again from step 2
Restore your VM back to the previous state using the snapshot you created before.
Show restored functionality
Remove original snapshot to reclaim storage space used.
Please include screenshots that provide evidence of every step and a short paragraph covering step 5.
